# Introducing docs.cdrsoftware.com

## Why docs.cdrsoftware.com?

In short, content matters. We interviewed and surveyed hundreds of developers and IT Pros and sifted through your website feedback over the years on UserVoice. It was clear we needed to make a change and create a modern web experience for content. The first thing we did was evaluate our existing content infrastructure. The prevous site was built on a 10-15 year-old brittle codebase with an archaic publishing and deployment system that was never designed to run on the cloud.

Our focus was not only on the experience, but also on the content we create and how each of you consume it. For years customers have told us to go beyond walls of text with feature-level content and help them implement solutions to their business problems. We knew that the content we delivered and the platform we built must make it easy for customers to learn and deploy solutions.

We realized that to get the overall experience right we needed to start from scratch; from this effort comes https://docs.cdrsoftware.com â€“ a new hope for documentation at CDR.

## Key features

Let's start with an example documentation page shown below and we'll showcase some of the new features on the site. ![Dacumentation](./images/DACumentation.png)

## Readablity

To improve content readability, we changed the site to have a set content width. Eye tracking studies have shown that you can improve comprehension and reading speed with a set content width as it's difficult for the eye to follow long passages left-to-right. We've also increased the font size for the left navigation and the text itself, something customers have been asking for.

## Estimated reading time and date stamping

Another simple enhancement we've made based on your input is to provide an estimated reading time for an article. We know many of you are learning/evaluating technology a few minutes between meetings and you're more likely to read articles if you knew how much of a time commitment is required. We also added date stamps to content to help customers understand how fresh the information is.

## Content and site navigation

One key area of investment based on customer feedback was improvements in site navigation, information architecture and content organization based on the customer's intent. We refactored our content into logical groupings around evaluating, getting started, planning, deploying, managing, or troubleshooting products or services. You can see this content broken down in both the left navigation and our product/service pages.

## Shortend article lenghth

Another common piece of feedback was that our content at times can be overwhelming because of its length and that long articles are more difficult to navigate and find what you're looking for. To address this, we've broken down many longer articles into smaller logical steps and provided Previous and Next buttons at the bottom of articles to navigate between steps in a multi-part tutorial as shown below.

## Responsive design

To build a great experience on mobile devices, tablets, and PCs, we switched to a responsive layout. Clicking the Options button will expand/collapse to show the same options on a desktop view.

## Community feedback mechanisms

Your questions, comments, and feedback are important to us. You are now able to provide comments and Sidenotes on all of our articles.

## Friendly URLs

We care about our web experience and one thing that regularly bugged us as users of documentation is that articles didn't have friendly, readable URLs or the ability to link to a section. Here's an example of the same article with our new URLs.

After: <https://docs.cdrsoftware.com/User%20Guide/Accounts%20Payable#adding-a-payment-batch>

## Website theming

We also added a theme picker to articles so that you can change between a light and dark theme.
