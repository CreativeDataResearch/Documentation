After using the Refresh Vendors From Dac application, users must edit the new A/P vendor records to enter data for the fields which are noted in the instructions below.

If necessary, CDR support personnel can include a function with the End Of Day (EOD) processing application which creates new A/P vendor records by copying only the Purchasing System vendor records added since EOD was last executed. Users would edit these new A/P vendor records also, as noted in the instructions.

### Working with A/P Item Records

After the vendor records are added, the Item Maintenance Details screen is used to add Accounts Payable (A/P) item records. The instructions given below, which describe adding and deleting an A/P item record, can also be followed to edit a record.

Accounts Payable item records are used to link A/P transactions with General Ledger (G/L) account numbers; therefore, an A/P item record must be created for each G/L account number that will be debited during invoice posting.

If DAC Purchasing System is used, A/P item records must be created to link purchasing transactions with the appropriate G/L account number.

If any PO off invoice deduction (5) type of vendor deal is used, the *VRDEAL5* A/P item record must be added. If any item allow-OI deduction (4) type of vendor deal is used, the *VRDEAL4* A/P item record must be added.
